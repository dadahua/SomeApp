**Last Updated**: March 1, 2026
**Developer**: [samuel]

## 1. Introduction
Thank you for choosing 2048 Watch ("the App"), a standalone puzzle game designed for Apple Watch. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe user experience.

This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is handled when you use our App. We want to be perfectly clear: **WE DO NOT COLLECT, STORE, OR SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION WHATSOEVER.**

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
The App is designed to operate entirely offline on your Apple Watch. We do not collect, transmit, or process any of the following:
*   Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email, or contact details.
*   Usage Data or Analytics.
*   Location Data.
*   Health or Fitness Data (despite being on Apple Watch, the App does not access the Health app).

### Game Data
*   **Local Storage**: The App may store your current game state, score, and settings locally on your Apple Watch or paired iPhone using standard Apple Watch storage mechanisms. This data is never transmitted off of your device.
*   **iCloud Sync**: [**OPTIONAL - DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DID NOT IMPLEMENT iCloud**] If enabled, game progress may be synced via Apple's iCloud service. We do not have access to this synced data; it is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App does not contain:
*   Advertising.
*   Third-party analytics tools (e.g., Firebase, Flurry).
*   Social media sharing features.

## 4. Multilingual Support
The App offers multiple language options (including English, Simplified Chinese, etc.). Language selection is processed locally on your device to adjust the in-app text display. No language preference data is sent to our servers (as we have no servers).

## 5. Children's Privacy
The App is suitable for users of all ages, including children. Since we do not collect any personal information, we fully comply with children's privacy regulations such as COPPA.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
